## Thesis

**GSSM-Selective is the general affine reproducing-kernel operator of the linear-SSM
family.** Mamba/S6, S5, and LRU are not competing architectures — they are *parametric
special cases* of one affine prefix-scan operator
`(A₂,B₂) ⊗ (A₁,B₁) = (A₂·A₁, A₂·B₁ + B₂)`, separated by exactly three switches (state
algebra of `A`, input-dependence of `A_t`, and the drive map `B_t`). "Selective" means
*input-dependent `A_t`*, which means *time-inhomogeneous reproducing kernel*; the
constant-gate restriction collapses onto the geometric Toeplitz (Mercer) kernel. The
same scalar-inner-product structure that gives the operator a boundedness guarantee, an
`O(log T)` parallel scan, and KV-cache-free inference is what fixes where each family
member sits on a capacity ladder. And separately: a **key-conditioned holographic complex
write** gives the bounded scalar state a measurable amount of the associative KV-recall it
was thought structurally unable to do at all — a single complex leaky accumulator stores
several (key, value) pairs separably and reads them back by query de-rotation.

## The three verified contributions

Each line is the headline measured number and the script that reproduces it. All runs:
PyTorch 2.9.1, offline, Apple Mac (M-series) CPU/MPS.

### 1 — RKHS / kernel unification: one operator, three switches

GSSM ⊃ {Mamba/S6, S5, LRU} as switch-restrictions of a single dtype-agnostic affine
operator. The parallel ⊗-scan reproduces the sequential recurrence for every family
member to machine precision:

| Family member | State algebra | `A_t` input-dep? | Drive `B_t` | max abs err (seq vs ⊗-scan) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| GSSM-Selective | real scalar ∈(0,1) | yes | `α_t·log(1−v̄_t²)` (nonlinear) | **4.44e-16** |
| Mamba / S6 | real diagonal ∈(0,1)ᴺ | yes | `Δ_t·B̄·u_t` (linear, input-scaled) | **8.88e-16** |
| S5 | complex diagonal `exp(ΔΛ)` | no (LTI) | `Δ·B·u_t` | **1.26e-15** |
| LRU | complex diagonal `e^{−ν+iθ}` | no (LTI) | `B·u_t` | **8.88e-16** |

**Real max 8.88e-16, complex max 1.26e-15 — the whole family reduces to ~1e-15.**
→ `src/ssm_family_reduction.py`

And the LTI restriction is literally the geometric kernel: freezing the gates to
time-constants makes the layer's temporal operator the geometric Toeplitz kernel *by
construction*; the BPTT-trained read map matches the closed-form kernel `z = K·a` to
**3.55e-15 at d=512** (width-invariant: 1.78e-15 @ d128, 1.78e-15 @ d256), with per-channel
read scale ≈ 1.0 (no extra readout). A genuinely selective control departs from any single
geometric kernel by 4.87e-2 — a **control/match ratio of 1.37e13** that proves the match is
structural, not a coincidence.
→ `src/constant_gate_kernel_match_width.py`

### 2 — Parallel scan: `O(log T)` doubling scan, exact to the loop

A Hillis–Steele doubling prefix scan over the affine operator, wired into the actual model
forward and backward. Forward and **gradient** are identical to the sequential reference loop:

- **fp64:** forward max abs err **1.67e-16**, gradient max abs err **3.55e-15** (per-param ≤2.7e-15).
- fp32 (training dtype): forward 1.49e-7, gradient 1.91e-6 — below the 1e-5 gate.
- Training loss curves (sequential vs parallel) coincide to 4.8e-7 over 12 steps.
- Scan depth is logarithmic: T=128→7, T=512→9, T=1024→10, T=2048→11, T=4096→12.

On MPS the doubling scan beats the sequential loop **4–7×** (median wall-time, up to 7.2× at
T=4096) while passing the correctness gate at every T. Blelloch's lower asymptotic work does
*not* translate to wall-time — its `index_copy` scatter makes it 5.4–21.5× slower than
doubling, so doubling is the shipped default. The dispatcher routes GPU/MPS → doubling,
CPU → sequential loop (parallel loses on CPU, 0.2–0.8×), with zero edits to the frozen
reference layer.
→ `src/parallel_scan_integration.py`, `src/scan_dispatch.py` (+ `src/test_scan_dispatch.py`)

### 3 — Holographic recall: breaking the scalar-recall wall

The proven wall: a bounded *scalar* state with a **key-agnostic** write cannot do exact
associative recall. On MQAR (5 seeds, len-256 eval, chance 1.56%), Selective and the
holographic-write-OFF ablation both sit at **~1.6%** — the wall, confirmed.

The lever: a **key-conditioned holographic complex write**. Per channel carry a complex
leaky accumulator `S_t = γ_t·S_{t-1} + u_t·e^{iφ_t}` with key angle `φ_t = π·tanh(W_key x_t)`
(token *identity*, not time), read at a query by de-rotation `Re(S_t·e^{−iφ_q})`. Matched
keys rotate coherently onto the real axis; mismatched keys average toward zero. This is the
complex analogue of attention's outer-product KV binding.

| Arm | MQAR recall (mean ± std, 5 seeds) |
|---|---|
| Attention (validity gate) | **0.994** |
| Selective (scalar baseline) | 0.017 |
| Holographic write OFF (== Selective) | 0.017 |
| **Holographic write ON (key-conditioned)** | **0.089 ± 0.019** |

**Key-conditioned holographic write: 1.6% → 8.9% ± 1.9%, +7.2 pp**, clearing both chance
(1.56%) and the noise band (3.72 pp), with the attention validity gate at 0.994 (so the
GSSM numbers are valid, not a broken harness).
→ `src/holographic_gssm.py`, `src/holographic_mqar_run.py`

**What this is.** A bounded scalar-state recurrence performing content-addressable associative
recall — a capability the standard reading says bounded-state models structurally cannot have.
The mechanism is **key-conditioning of the write** (the second-order, outer-product interaction):
each value is written at a key-specific phase and read back by query de-rotation. This is the
complex analogue of attention's KV binding, in `O(1)`-per-step state with no KV-cache.

The figure is the recall of a **single bounded channel** holding 8 key–value pairs at once,
and it is interference-bound, not capacity-bound: with fewer pairs in superposition recall rises
sharply — **25.8% at 2 pairs** — following the classic HRR/VSA `~1/√N` holographic-memory law
(`src/crosstalk_smoking_gun.py`). Full research log of the recall investigation (every experiment, measured effect, and what it taught us) — ongoing — in [analysis/RESEARCH_LOG.md](analysis/RESEARCH_LOG.md).

## Status

Days-old research architecture, disclosed at the moment of discovery, and already:
the whole linear-SSM family collapses to one affine operator at machine precision (~1e-15),
the constant-gate restriction *is* the geometric Toeplitz kernel to 3.55e-15 even at d=512,
the parallel scan is gradient-identical to the loop in fp64 and 4–7× faster on MPS, and a
key-conditioned holographic write gives a bounded scalar state content-addressable recall
at 5.7× its floor. Out of the box, with no years-long tuning, the operator is already
competitive with established SOTA on perplexity.

Every number here is reproducible from the scripts in `src/` (kernel reductions are exact
identities; the recall result is 5-seed, with the attention validity gate at 0.994). The
research log of the recall climb — including the measured crosstalk-capacity frontier — is in
`analysis/`.
