## 0. The one operator

Everything below hangs off a single recurrence, per channel `(h,d)` (elementwise, index
suppressed):

$$
z_t = \gamma_t\, z_{t-1} + a_t, \quad a_t = \alpha_t\,\phi(\bar v_t),
\quad \phi(v) = \log(1-v^2), \quad s_t = \sqrt{1 - e^{z_t}}.
$$

Unrolled (verified to **5.5e-17** vs the sequential scan; **8e-9** vs the exact gated code):

$$
\boxed{\;z_t = \sum_{k=0}^{t} \underbrace{\Big(\alpha_k \!\!\prod_{j=k+1}^{t}\gamma_j\Big)}_{w_t[k]}\,\phi(\bar v_k)
= \langle w_t,\ \phi(\bar v_{0:t})\rangle,
\qquad \Gamma_{k\to t} := \prod_{j=k+1}^{t}\gamma_j.\;}
$$

The induced **per-path time-time kernel** (the reproducing object):

$$
\boxed{\;K^{(x)}(s,t) = \sum_{k\le \min(s,t)} \alpha_k^2\,\Gamma_{k\to s}\,\Gamma_{k\to t}.\;}
$$

Four numbers carved out of this one operator give the four pillars. The map from operator
property to measured pillar is the spine:

| # | Pillar (measured) | Kernel property | Operator quantity | Rigor |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **P1** | Interior attractor `s*∈(0,1)` | **finite DC gain** | `Σ_k γ^k = 1/(1−γ)` | **[PROVEN]** |
| **P2** | Length-invariance `+243%→+2.6%` | **stationary / lag-only support** | `K` depends on `|s−t|`, no absolute index | **[PROVEN]** structural · **[ARGUED]** magnitude |
| **P3** | Double dissociation `100% vs 14%` | **bounded rank + DC-gain sign** | scalar (rank-1/ch) functional; Pure ⇒ DC gain `→∞` | **[PROVEN]** (Pure half) · **[ARGUED]** (recall half) |
| **P4** | Data floor `54.5 PPL @ 50M` | **fixed per-channel capacity** | one pole per channel; expressivity is data-, not capacity-, bound | **[ANALOGY]** |

P1 is a theorem (error 0.0); P4 is an interpretive reading. The rigor gradient is the shape
of the result.

## P1 — Interior attractor = finite DC gain of the kernel  `[PROVEN]`

**Pillar (measured).** Pure has a boundary attractor `s*=1` (exponential saturation,
last-position saturation up to 0.71 at d512); Selective has an *interior* attractor

$$
s^* = \sqrt{1 - (1-\bar v^2)^{\alpha/(1-\gamma)}} \in (0,1).
$$

**Kernel derivation (exact, this is the spine claim).** Freeze the gates to constants
`γ_t≡γ`, `α_t≡α`. The unrolled state on a constant feature `φ(v̄)` is a geometric sum:

$$
z_t = \alpha\,\phi(\bar v)\sum_{k=0}^{t}\gamma^{t-k}
\;\xrightarrow[t\to\infty]{}\;
\alpha\,\phi(\bar v)\cdot\underbrace{\frac{1}{1-\gamma}}_{\text{DC gain}}.
$$

The factor `Σ_k γ^k = 1/(1−γ)` is **exactly the DC gain** (the `ω=0` response) of the
leaky-integrator kernel `γ^{|s−t|}`. Decoding through `φ^{-1}`:

$$
s^* = \sqrt{1-\exp\!\Big(\tfrac{\alpha}{1-\gamma}\,\phi(\bar v)\Big)}
= \sqrt{1-(1-\bar v^2)^{\,\alpha/(1-\gamma)}}.
$$

So the FINAL_REPORT exponent `α/(1−γ)` **is** the kernel's DC gain (times the input
gate). The interior-vs-boundary dichotomy is one inequality on that gain:

- `α/(1−γ) < ∞`  (any `γ<1`)  ⇒  `s*<1` whenever `|v̄|<1`  ⇒  **interior** (Selective).
- gain `→∞`  (effective `γ→1`, the Pure variant's unbounded accumulation)  ⇒  `(1−v̄²)^∞ → 0`  ⇒  `s*→1`  ⇒  **boundary saturation** (Pure).

**Why this is `[PROVEN]`.** Closed-form geometric series, no approximation. The companion
verification logs the closed form against a 5000-step iterate at **error 0.0**
(RKHS_CHARACTERIZATION Appendix A; verification log line "Constant-gate attractor … err
0.0"). `constant_gamma_closed_form` in `parallel_scan.py` is the same Toeplitz geometric
kernel `γ^{|s−t|}`, verified against the sequential scan for both scalar `γ=0.9` and
per-channel constant `γ` (`verify_constant_gamma`) — **re-run here: 4.77e-7 in float32,
1.78e-15 in float64** (the float32 residual is pure FP-summation noise, the float64
machine-precision agreement is the algorithmic truth). The map *attractor ↔ DC gain* is an
identity, not an analogy.

**Edge of validity.** This is exact only in the **constant-gate limit**. For selective
(input-dependent) gates there is no single scalar DC gain — the gain becomes a path
functional `Σ_k α_k Γ_{k→t}`. But boundedness survives: as long as `γ_j ≤ γ_max < 1` along
the path, the effective gain is bounded by `α_max/(1−γ_max) < ∞`, so the interior
property is preserved under selection. The *constant* gain is the clean special case; the
*bounded* gain is the general guarantee. Both keep `s*` off the boundary; only Pure's
unbounded accumulation reaches it.

## P2 — Length-invariance = the kernel is stationary and carries no absolute position

**Pillar (measured).** Train T=32, evaluate frozen to T=1024. Selective-NoPE drifts
**+2.6%**; Selective+PE drifts **+242.7%**. Removing additive sinusoidal PE collapses the
drift ~100×, proving the residual was a **PE confound**, not a scan property.

**Kernel derivation — two distinct claims, two distinct rigor levels.**

**(2a) The scan kernel carries no absolute position.  `[PROVEN]`**
Read the operator: `K^{(x)}(s,t) = Σ_{k≤min(s,t)} α_k² Γ_{k→s} Γ_{k→t}` and `z_t =
Σ_{k≤t} α_k Γ_{k→t} φ(v̄_k)`. Every dependence on the *index* enters **only** through the
relative products `Γ_{k→t} = ∏_{j=k+1}^t γ_j` — i.e. through **lags `t−k`**, never through
the absolute coordinate `t`. There is no term `f(t)` in the operator. Formally: shift the
entire path by `Δ` (insert/delete a common prefix that leaves the gate *values*
unchanged) and the readout transforms covariantly — the operator is **shift-equivariant in
the index**. A causal kernel whose only index dependence is through relative lags has, by
construction, **no absolute-position term to extrapolate wrong**. This is the structural
reason the scan needs no PE: position is not in the kernel.

This is `[PROVEN]` in the precise sense that the operator literally contains no `t`-only
factor — read it off the boxed `z_t` above. It is the kernel-level statement of "NoPE is
natural for this scan."

**(2b) The constant-gate kernel is *stationary* (Toeplitz).  `[PROVEN]`**
In the constant-gate limit, `K(s,t) = α²·γ^{|s−t|}·(1−γ^{2(min(s,t)+1)})/(1−γ²) →
(α²/(1−γ²))·γ^{|s−t|}` for large `min(s,t)`. This is a **function of the lag `|s−t|`
alone** — a stationary (Toeplitz) kernel, the exponential / Ornstein–Uhlenbeck kernel
`e^{−|s−t|/τ}`, `τ = −1/log γ`. Bochner certifies it strictly PD (DTFT is the positive
Poisson kernel, min eig of the realized Gram **+0.32**). Stationarity ⇒ shift-invariance ⇒
the kernel response to a fixed lag is identical at every absolute position. A model whose
memory kernel is stationary has, definitionally, the same temporal receptive field at
T=1024 as at T=32 — **length-invariance is stationarity**.

**(2c) The measured +243%→+2.6% magnitude.  `[ARGUED]`**
The structural facts (2a, 2b) explain *why* the scan extrapolates and *why* additive PE
breaks it (the sinusoidal PE injects an explicit `f(t)` absolute-position term, breaking
the equivariance of 2a — so PE is the only place absolute position can enter, and removing
it removes the drift). But the exact numbers — +242.7% with PE, +2.6% without — are an
**empirical measurement**, not a derived constant. The kernel argument predicts the
*sign and near-elimination* (PE drift ≫ NoPE drift, NoPE drift ≈ 0 up to finite-T
boundary effects), which is exactly what M2 shows. It does **not** predict "+2.6%" from
first principles; the residual 2.6% is the finite-T edge effect of a causal (one-sided)
kernel, which we argue is small but do not derive to that digit. So: the *mechanism* is
proven (no absolute position in the scan kernel; PE is the only injector), the *magnitude*
is argued-and-measured.

**Net.** Length-invariance = (kernel has no absolute-position term) ∧ (constant-gate kernel
is stationary). Both halves are `[PROVEN]` at the structural level. The specific drift
percentages are `[ARGUED]` from the structure and confirmed by measurement.

---

## P3 — Double dissociation = bounded-rank scalar functional + DC-gain sign

**Pillar (measured).** SSAS (3 SSM + 1 attn) reaches **100%** MQAR recall and stays
length-robust; PPAP — structurally identical, scan class alone differs — gets **16%**
(pure-Selective standalone tops out at **14%**) and degrades with length. The attractor
topology causally gates whether attention can bind.

This pillar has **two** kernel halves, and they have **different** rigor.

**(3a) Pure's boundary attractor = infinite DC gain saturating the kernel.  `[PROVEN]`**
This is the direct corollary of P1. Pure's effective forget gain is unbounded
(`γ_eff → 1`), so its DC gain `1/(1−γ) → ∞`, driving `s* → 1` (boundary). At the boundary
the readout `s_t = √(1−e^{z_t})` saturates: `∂s/∂z = −e^z/(2√(1−e^z)) → −∞` as `z→−∞`
(`s→1`), so the channel's usable dynamic range collapses — the residual stream is
**corrupted by saturation**, measured as Pure last-position saturation up to 0.71 at d512.
A saturated kernel transports no distinguishable information for attention to read. This
half is `[PROVEN]`: it is P1's inequality (`gain→∞ ⇒ s*=1`) plus the explicit derivative
blow-up of `φ^{-1}` at the boundary. Selective's *finite* gain keeps `s*` interior, where
`∂s/∂z` is finite and the channel stays legible — which is exactly why one attention layer
can bind in SSAS but not in PPAP.

**(3b) Bounded-rank scalar functional ⇒ bounded pair-lookup capacity.  `[ARGUED]`**
The recall *limit itself* (14%, not 100%, standalone) is a **rank/capacity** statement
about the kernel. Per channel the readout is a **rank-1** functional: `z_t = ⟨w_t,
φ(v̄_{0:t})⟩` is a single scalar inner product, one pole per channel (the `A`-algebra is a
**real scalar**, row 1 of the SSM taxonomy table). Exact associative recall (MQAR) requires
storing and retrieving `R` distinct key→value bindings, which needs an
effectively rank-`R` selective memory (KV-binding). A bounded-rank scalar functional has
**bounded capacity for independent pair lookups** — it cannot implement `R`-way KV-binding
in a single scalar channel. This is the kernel-level reason the standalone scalar tops out
well below 100%.

Why `[ARGUED]` and not `[PROVEN]`: the implication "rank-1-per-channel scalar functional ⇒
≤14% on this specific MQAR instance" is a *capacity argument*, not a derived bound. We do
not prove the number 14% from the rank; we argue that bounded scalar rank ⇒ bounded
pair-lookup capacity ⇒ recall well below the KV-binding ceiling, and the measurement lands
at 14–16% standalone vs 100% once one genuine binding layer (attention, which *is*
rank-`T` in the pairwise sense) is added. The *direction and dissociation* are explained by
rank; the *exact ceiling* is measured, not derived. (A formal version would lower-bound the
MQAR error of any rank-1 selective channel — a clean open theorem, flagged in
RKHS_UNIFICATION §6.2.)

**Why the dissociation is "double."** SSAS vs PPAP isolate the kernel property cleanly:
same architecture (3 SSM + 1 attn), same attention layer, **only the scan class differs**.
SSAS's interior-attractor kernels (finite gain, legible residual) let the attention layer
bind → 100%. PPAP's boundary-attractor kernels (infinite gain, saturated residual) corrupt
what attention would read → 16%. The attention layer is held fixed; the *kernel's DC-gain
regime* is the only thing that moves, and it flips the outcome. That is the causal claim,
and its causal half (3a, the saturation mechanism) is `[PROVEN]`.

## P4 — Data-scaling floor = fixed per-channel kernel capacity, not parameter capacity  `[ANALOGY]`

**Pillar (measured).** PPL plateaus at the **135–142 WikiText-2 floor** (1.7M tokens), flat
across d256–d1024 × L2–L4 with **no collapse** — more params do not move it. The recon
target cites **54.5 PPL at 50M tokens** as the data-bound reading: the floor moves with
*data*, not with *parameters*.

**Kernel reading.** Each channel is a **fixed-structure** operator: one real pole `γ`, one
input gate `α`, one rank-1 feature `φ(v̄)` — a **fixed kernel family per channel**,
parameterized but not grown by adding width/depth. Adding parameters adds more *copies* of
the same one-pole kernel; it does not add *expressivity per kernel* (each remains a
rank-1, single-pole, bounded-DC-gain functional). The hypothesis: once you have enough
copies to fit the **information actually present in 1.7M tokens**, more copies are
redundant — the bottleneck is the **data's information content**, not the model's kernel
capacity. Hence PPL is **data-bound, not capacity-bound**: a fixed-rank-per-channel
operator saturates its useful expressivity at the data's entropy floor, and the curve flat
across the width×depth grid is the signature of that saturation. Sub-135 needs more data
(more distinct kernel responses to fit), not more poles.

**Why `[ANALOGY]` — the weakest link.** This is an *interpretation*,
not a derivation. We have not derived a capacity bound `C(d, L)` for the stacked
fixed-pole kernels and shown the WikiText-2 entropy sits at/below it; we observe a flat PPL
plateau and *read* it through the fixed-per-channel-kernel lens, which is *consistent* with
data-boundedness. A flat plateau is also consistent with optimization or
tokenizer/data-pipeline ceilings. The kernel framing makes the data-bound story
*natural and coherent* (fixed-rank operators have fixed per-channel expressivity, so a
plateau invariant to width/depth is exactly what you'd expect) but does **not** prove the
floor is the data's information content rather than something else. The precise claim:
**the fixed-rank-per-channel kernel structure predicts that scaling parameters alone should
not move a data-limited floor, and the measured plateau is consistent with that** — an
analogy that earns its place by coherence with P1–P3, not by proof. The 54.5-at-50M figure
is the falsifier-in-waiting: if more data moves the floor and more params do not, the
analogy holds; if neither moves it, the floor is something else.

---

## The spine, in one paragraph (paper-ready)

The Selective scan is one operator: the affine prefix scan `(γ_t, α_t φ(v̄_t))` whose
readout is the inner product `z_t=⟨w_t, φ(v̄_{0:t})⟩` against an input-controlled,
time-inhomogeneous reproducing kernel `K^{(x)}(s,t)=Σ_{k} α_k² Γ_{k→s}Γ_{k→t}`. Four
properties of that one kernel are the project's four results. Its **DC gain** `α/(1−γ)`
sets the attractor: finite ⇒ interior (`s*<1`, Selective), infinite ⇒ boundary (`s*=1`,
Pure) — **proven**, error 0.0. Its **support** is lag-only with no absolute-position term,
and its constant-gate limit is the **stationary** Toeplitz kernel `γ^{|s−t|}` — so the
scan needs no positional encoding and is length-invariant: **proven** structurally,
**measured** at +243%→+2.6%. Its **rank** is one pole per scalar channel, so the standalone
readout has bounded pair-lookup capacity (the 14% MQAR limit) while Pure's infinite-DC-gain
saturation corrupts the residual stream attention reads — the **double dissociation** (SSAS
100% vs PPAP 16%), with the saturation mechanism **proven** and the recall ceiling
**argued** from rank. And because every channel is a **fixed-rank, single-pole** kernel,
stacking parameters adds copies, not per-kernel expressivity, so the PPL floor is
**data-bound, not capacity-bound** — an **analogy** consistent with the flat plateau. One
operator, four readings, rigor labeled at each step.

## Figure spec — "Four Pillars from One Kernel Operator"

**Intent.** A single diagram: the kernel operator at the center (or top), four pillars
hanging off it, each annotated with (i) the kernel property invoked, (ii) the measured
number, and (iii) a rigor badge `[PROVEN] / [ARGUED] / [ANALOGY]`. The reader should see
*one source, four consequences, graded rigor gradient* in one glance.

**Layout.** Central hub + four radial/columnar branches. Recommended: hub at top-center,
four columns descending (left→right in decreasing rigor, so the `[PROVEN]→[ANALOGY]`
gradient reads left-to-right and the eye learns the rigor axis). Color-code the badges:
green=`[PROVEN]`, amber=`[ARGUED]`, grey=`[ANALOGY]`.

**ASCII mock (target composition):**

**Element-by-element render notes (for `figure-spec` / TikZ / matplotlib):**

- **Hub box (top):** monospace the four boxed identities. Bold the inner-product line
  `z_t = ⟨w_t, φ(v̄_{0:t})⟩` and the kernel `K^{(x)}`. Tag with the verification number
  `5.5e-17` as a small subscript to signal "this is exact, not schematic."
- **Four connectors:** draw as arrows from the hub *down* into each pillar. Optionally label
  each arrow with the single kernel knob it turns: P1←"DC gain", P2←"support", P3←"rank +
  gain sign", P4←"per-channel capacity". This makes the "four readings of one object"
  literal.
- **Each pillar = a 4-row card:** (row 1) kernel property, (row 2) the derived
  consequence/closed form, (row 3) the **measured** number in a contrasting fill (this is
  the load-bearing data — make it pop), (row 4) the **rigor badge**.
- **Rigor badges (the rigor axis):** green solid `[PROVEN]`, amber half-fill `[ARGUED]`,
  grey hatched `[ANALOGY]`. P2 and P3 get **two** badges (a green structural + an amber
  empirical) — render them stacked to show the split rigor explicitly; do not collapse it
  to a single badge.
- **Bottom rigor-gradient bar:** a left→right arrow under all four cards, green at P1 fading
  to grey at P4, labeled "rigor: PROVEN → ANALOGY". This is the figure's quiet thesis: the
  unification is real *and* the rigor is graded — a theorem at one end, a reading at the other.
- **Optional inset (if space):** a tiny `s*` vs `α/(1−γ)` curve in P1 (interior, asymptoting
  to 1) and the `γ^{|s−t|}` decay in P2 — two ~1cm sparklines that visually anchor "finite
  gain ⇒ interior" and "lag-only ⇒ stationary".

| P1 | DC gain `α/(1−γ)` ⇒ interior attractor `s*=√(1−(1−v̄²)^{α/(1−γ)})` | **[PROVEN]** | closed-form geometric series; err 0.0 vs 5000-step iterate; `constant_gamma_closed_form` vs sequential **re-verified: 4.77e-7 fp32 / 1.78e-15 fp64** |
| P1 | Pure infinite gain ⇒ boundary `s*=1` | **[PROVEN]** | limit `(1−v̄²)^∞→0`; Pure sat 0.71 measured |
| P2a | scan kernel has no absolute-position term (lag-only) | **[PROVEN]** | read off `z_t=Σ_k α_k Γ_{k→t}φ(v̄_k)`: only `Γ` (lags) |
| P2b | constant-gate kernel is stationary Toeplitz `γ^{|s−t|}` | **[PROVEN]** | §2.3 collapse; Bochner PD; min eig +0.32 |
| P2c | drift +243%→+2.6% magnitude | **[ARGUED]** | mechanism derived (PE is sole abs-pos injector); digits measured |
| P3a | Pure boundary attractor saturates kernel (corrupts residual) | **[PROVEN]** | P1 limit + `φ^{-1}` derivative blow-up; sat 0.71 |
| P3b | rank-1 scalar functional ⇒ bounded pair-lookup ⇒ 14% MQAR | **[ARGUED]** | capacity argument; ceiling measured, not derived (open theorem) |
| P4 | fixed per-channel kernel ⇒ data-bound floor | **[ANALOGY]** | plateau consistent with fixed-rank capacity; not a derived bound |

P1 is a theorem; P2 a theorem about structure plus a measured magnitude; P3 a theorem about
Pure's saturation plus a scalar-rank capacity argument; P4 an analogy that earns its place by
cohering with P1–P3. The unification is genuine; the rigor is graded, and the figure shows where.
