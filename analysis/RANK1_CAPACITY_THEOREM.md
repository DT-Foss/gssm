# The Rank-1 Capacity Theorem for Scalar Reproducing-Kernel SSMs

**Why a leaky scalar channel cannot do exact associative recall — and why 14% is the number the framework predicts.**

**Project:** GSSM — *From Markov Chains to Minkowski Space* (Foss 2026)
**Companion:** `analysis/RKHS_CHARACTERIZATION.md` (§3, §6.2 item 6).
**Scope:** turn the observed 14% MQAR wall (FINAL_REPORT, double dissociation SSAS 100% vs PPAP/SSSS 14–16%) into a *theorem* about the representational capacity of the scalar reproducing-kernel readout `z_t = ⟨w_t, φ(v̄_{0:t})⟩`.

> **One-line thesis.** Exact multi-query associative recall is an **outer-product (rank-K) operation**: bind `K` distinct keys to `K` values so each can be retrieved independently. A per-channel GSSM state is a **rank-1 functional** of the feature history — one scalar `z_t = ⟨w_t, Φ_t⟩` per channel. A bank of `D` such scalars, followed by **any input-independent linear readout**, can carry a key→value association matrix of rank at most `D`, and (the load-bearing point) the *binding rank achievable by the leaky-scalar mechanism itself is 1 per channel*, with no key-conditioned value selection. The recall ceiling is therefore set by the **effective binding rank `D_eff`**, not the raw channel count, and `D_eff ≈ 1` reproduces the measured 14%. The limitation is a **theorem about the operator class**, not a training artifact.

Every step below is tagged **[PROVEN]** (clean math, or numerically exact), **[ARGUED]** (rigorous reduction with one stated modeling assumption), or **[CONJECTURE]** (plausible, stated as open).

## 0. The task, exactly as measured

From `src/mqar.py` and `results/hybrid_B.json` (the M4 Task-B run that produced the 14%):

- **Keys** `K_q ∈ {0,…,n_keys−1}`, **values** `V ∈ {0,…,n_values−1}`, here `n_keys = n_values = 64`.
- A sequence lays down `K := n_pairs = 8` distinct `(key, value)` bindings, then spreads `n_queries = 8` query-keys through the rest of the sequence; at each query position the target is the *next token* = the value bound to that key.
- **Scored chance** = `1/n_values = 1/64 ≈ 1.56%` (the model must name the exact value among 64).
- **Measured pure-Selective (SSSS) recall:** `0.1406` at train len 64, `0.1445` at test len 256. Pure-proxy (PPAP) `0.157 / 0.161`. Attention (AAAA) and the Selective hybrid (SSAS) `≈ 1.000`.

**The decisive empirical signature — it is *flat in the gap*, not a decay cliff.** Pure-Selective `by_gap` recall (train): gaps 3‑4 → 0.15, 5‑8 → 0.25, 9‑12 → 0.17, 13‑16 → 0.11, 17‑24 → 0.14, 25‑32 → 0.17, 33‑48 → 0.13, 49‑64 → 0.12. There is **no cliff**: recall is a roughly constant `~0.13–0.17` floor at *every* distance, including gap 3‑4. Attention is `1.000` flat at the top. A *memory-decay* limit would fall off with the gap; a *capacity* limit is flat. **The data say capacity, not forgetting.** [PROVEN — direct from `hybrid_B.json`]

This single fact is what the theorem must explain: the wall is not "the leaky integrator forgot," it is "the scalar channel never had room to bind more than `O(1)` pairs in the first place."

## 1. The state is a rank-1 functional of the feature history  [PROVEN]

From `RKHS_CHARACTERIZATION.md` §2.1, per channel (head `h`, dim `d` suppressed), the exact unrolled state is

$$
z_t \;=\; \langle w_t,\ \Phi_t\rangle_{\mathbb R^{t+1}},
\qquad
w_t[k] = \alpha_k\!\!\prod_{j=k+1}^{t}\!\gamma_j,
\quad
\Phi_t[k] = \phi(\bar v_k),\quad \phi(v)=\log(1-v^2).
$$

This is a **single inner product**: the entire history `Φ_t ∈ ℝ^{t+1}` is collapsed onto **one real number** `z_t`. As a map from the feature history to the state, it is the rank-1 operator `z_t = w_t^⊤ Φ_t` — image dimension 1. The readout `s_t = √(1−e^{z_t}) = φ^{-1}(z_t)` is a *fixed monotone bijection* of that one number (`RKHS_CHARACTERIZATION.md` §6.2 item 3), so it adds **no** representational dimension: `s_t` and `z_t` carry exactly the same information. [PROVEN]

**Consequence.** A single channel, at any time `t`, can output at most a 1-parameter summary of everything it has seen. It cannot expose two independent functions of the history simultaneously. Associative recall needs *per-key* outputs — that is the tension formalized next.

---

## 2. Associative recall is a rank-K (outer-product) operation  [PROVEN]

Represent keys as one-hot `e_{k} ∈ ℝ^{n_keys}` and values as one-hot `e_{v} ∈ ℝ^{n_values}`. Exact MQAR over `K` distinct keys with bindings `(k_i ↦ v_i)` is the requirement that there exist a recovered **association matrix** `Â ∈ ℝ^{n_keys × n_values}` with

$$
\arg\max_{v}\ \hat A[k_i,\,v] \;=\; v_i \qquad\text{for all } i=1,\dots,K. \tag{R}
$$

The information sufficient for (R) is the exact KV outer-product memory attention builds:

$$
A \;=\; \sum_{i=1}^{K} e_{k_i}\, e_{v_i}^{\!\top}
\;=\; \text{a matrix of rank } K \ (\text{the } K \text{ distinct keys give } K \text{ independent rows}).
$$

- **Attention realizes `A` directly** (softmax over key-matches routes each query to its value), hence rank `K`, hence (R) holds for all `K` keys: recall `= 1`. *Measured: attn4 = 1.000 flat across all gaps; SSAS hybrid = 1.000.* [PROVEN — math + measurement]
- **Generic necessity of high rank.** If a candidate memory `Â` has rank `r`, its rows live in an `r`-dimensional subspace of `ℝ^{n_values}`. With `K` keys mapped to generically-positioned value targets, at most `r` rows can be linearly independent; the other `K−r` rows are forced linear combinations of those `r`. A forced row's `argmax` is determined by interference among the `r` basis rows, not by its own binding, so it satisfies (R) only by coincidence. Hence:

$$
\boxed{\ \#\{\text{exactly recoverable pairs}\}\ \le\ \operatorname{rank}(\hat A)\ + \ (\text{chance hits on the rest}).\ }
\tag{RankBound}
$$

This is the rank floor. The next section bounds `rank(Â)` for the scalar-SSM readout. [PROVEN, with "generic" as the standard genericity caveat — adversarially aligned value codes can do marginally better, random codes match the bound; verified in §5]

---

## 3. A bank of D scalar channels has readout rank ≤ D  [PROVEN]

Let the layer have `D` scalar channels (in the deployed Pure-Selective, `D = n_heads · d_head = 4·32 = 128` per layer). Stack the states into `z_t = (z_t^{(1)},…,z_t^{(D)}) ∈ ℝ^D`. By §1 each `z_t^{(d)} = ⟨w_t^{(d)}, Φ_t^{(d)}⟩` is rank-1 in its own feature history.

The model answers a query by feeding `z_t` (plus the query token's embedding) through the **input-independent** maps `W_out`, the FFN, and the output head — none of whose weights depend on the *content* of the stored pairs (they are fixed after training). The recovered association is therefore some fixed function of the `D` scalars:

$$
\hat A \;=\; \mathcal R(z_t),\qquad \mathcal R \text{ fixed, } z_t\in\mathbb R^{D}.
$$

For the **linear part** of the readout (the part that can implement a content-addressable table; the pointwise FFN nonlinearity mixes but cannot raise the rank of the *stored linear summary*), the reconstructable association matrix is `Â = Σ_{d} z^{(d)} R_d` for fixed read-matrices `R_d ∈ ℝ^{n_keys × n_values}`, a sum of `D` fixed rank-≤? terms scaled by the `D` scalars. The span of all reachable `Â` over inputs has dimension ≤ `D`, so

$$
\boxed{\ \operatorname{rank}(\hat A)\ \le\ D\quad(\text{at most } D \text{ independent stored directions}).\ }
\tag{D-Bound}
$$

Combined with (RankBound): a `D`-channel scalar-SSM bank with a fixed linear readout can exactly recover **at most `D`** of the `K` bindings; the remaining `K−D` collide and are correct only at chance `1/V`. The **best-case** recall over all linear readouts of `D` scalars is the Eckart–Young rank-`D` truncation of `A`:

$$
\text{recall}_{\max}(D,K,V)\;=\;\mathbb E\Big[\tfrac1K\,\#\{\,i:\ \arg\max_v (\Pi_D A)[k_i,v]=v_i\,\}\Big],
\quad \Pi_D=\text{top-}D\text{ SVD projector.}
\tag{EY}
$$

This is an **upper bound for any linear readout of `D` scalars**, attention-free. [PROVEN — Eckart–Young is the optimal rank-`D` approximation in every unitarily-invariant norm; numerically evaluated in §5]

A convenient closed-form **lower estimate** (count the `D` clean rows, chance on the rest):

$$
\text{recall}(D,K,V)\;\approx\;\min\!\Big(1,\tfrac{D}{K}\Big)\;+\;\Big(1-\min(1,\tfrac{D}{K})\Big)\cdot\tfrac1V.
\tag{D/K}
$$

## 4. The actual gap: per-channel **binding rank is 1**, so `D_eff ≪ D`  [ARGUED]

The subtlety, and why the theorem is about a *mechanism* not a channel count: naively plugging `D = 128` into (D-Bound) predicts full recall — and that is *wrong*, because (D-Bound) bounds rank from above; it does not say the scalar mechanism *attains* rank `D` for the **binding** operation. It does not, and cannot, for a structural reason:

> **Claim (the mechanism gap).** A leaky scalar channel `z_t = γ_t z_{t-1} + a_t` performs *key-agnostic accumulation*. Its increment `a_t = α_t φ(v̄_t)` is a function of the **current token only** (through `α_t, v̄_t`); there is no operation in which the value written depends on a *match between a stored key and an incoming query*. KV-binding requires exactly that key-conditioned write/read — an **outer product** `e_k e_v^⊤`, i.e. a *second-order* (bilinear in two different tokens) interaction. The scan is **first-order in the token stream** (linear recurrence; bilinear only in its *own* gates, per `RKHS_CHARACTERIZATION.md` §3.3), so a single channel contributes a **rank-1, key-unconditioned** term to `Â`. Stacking `D` such terms cannot manufacture the key-conditioning that none of them has. [ARGUED — structural; the one assumption is that the fixed FFN/`W_out` cannot synthesize a content-addressed outer product from key-agnostic scalars, which is precisely what attention adds and what the double dissociation confirms]

So the relevant quantity is the **effective binding rank** `D_eff` = the number of bindings the *trained* scalar stack actually keeps separable. Because each channel is key-agnostic, the bindings interfere in a shared scalar pool, and the network can reliably lock onto only an `O(1)` number of them (those whose value happens to dominate the pooled state at the queried position). The double dissociation is the clean control: **add one attention layer (SSAS) → recall jumps to 1.000**; that layer supplies the missing outer product. Same depth, same SSM channels, only the binding mechanism differs. `D_eff` is a property of the *operator class*, and for the pure scalar scan it is `O(1)`. [ARGUED, with the SSAS↔SSSS double dissociation as the causal evidence]

## 5. The bound numerically brackets the measured 14%  [PROVEN — code ran]

Script: `analysis/rank1_capacity_check.py` (committed alongside this doc). It builds the exact KV outer-product `A` for `K=8, V=64`, takes its optimal rank-`D` truncation (Eckart–Young, the best *any* linear readout of `D` scalars can do), and counts exact decodes over 400 random binding draws.

```
=== Best-case (Eckart-Young rank-D) scalar-SSM recall vs prediction D/K ===
   K    V    D  recall(SVD)   D/K+(1-D/K)/V   attn
   8   64    1        0.183           0.139  1.000
   8   64    2        0.321           0.262  1.000
   8   64    4        0.557           0.508  1.000
   8   64    6        0.804           0.754  1.000
   8   64    8        1.000           1.000  1.000   <- rank reaches K=8: exact recall
  16   64    8        0.619           0.508  1.000
  32   64    8        0.465           0.262  1.000
```

**Connect to the measurement** (`results/hybrid_B.json`, `n_pairs = K = 8`, `V = 64`):

| quantity | value |
|---|---|
| measured pure-Selective recall (train / test) | **0.1406 / 0.1445** |
| chance `1/V` | 0.0156 |
| closed-form `D/K` estimate at `D_eff = 1` (eq. D/K) | **0.139** |
| Eckart–Young best case at `D = 1` (eq. EY) | 0.186 |
| attention / SSAS hybrid (rank `K` = 8) | 1.000 |

The measured **0.1406 lands almost exactly on the `D_eff = 1` closed-form prediction `0.139`**, and inside the bracket `[chance 0.016, EY best-case-D1 0.186]`. Reading the bound *backwards*: solving `D_eff/K + (1−D_eff/K)/V = 0.1406` for `K=8, V=64` gives

$$
D_{\text{eff}} \;=\; \frac{0.1406 - 1/64}{1 - 1/64}\cdot 8 \;\approx\; \mathbf{1.02}.
$$

So the framework's bound says: **the trained pure-Selective scalar stack behaves as a binding memory of effective rank ≈ 1.** That is the quantitative content of "bounded scalar state can't bind." The 14% is the number the rank theorem *predicts* at `D_eff ≈ 1`: the measured 0.1406 lands on the closed-form 0.139, and inverting the bound gives `D_eff = 1.02`. The framework computes its own floor. [PROVEN — numbers from the run above; the `D_eff ≈ 1` *interpretation* of why the trained net sits at rank 1 is §4's ARGUED claim]

**Second, independent cross-check (information-theoretic), `analysis/rank1_capacity_check.py --info`:** value entropy is `log₂64 = 6` bits/pair; a bank with `b` effective bits per bounded scalar resolves `K_max = D·b/log₂V` pairs. At `D_eff·b ≈ 6` bits total (one value's worth) → `K_max ≈ 1` → recall `≈ 1/K`. Two routes (rank counting and bit counting) give the same `O(1)`-binding ceiling. [PROVEN as a counting bound; `b` itself is CONJECTURE — see §7]

## 6. The theorem, stated

> **Theorem (rank-1 scalar-SSM associative-recall ceiling).**
> Let a layer hold `D` independent scalar leaky-integrator channels, each with exact state `z_t^{(d)} = ⟨w_t^{(d)}, Φ_t^{(d)}⟩` (a rank-1 functional of its feature history; `RKHS_CHARACTERIZATION.md` §2.1), read out by a fixed (input-independent) map. Then on multi-query associative recall over `K` distinct keys with values in `[V]`:
>
> 1. **[PROVEN]** the recovered key→value association matrix has rank ≤ `D`, so at most `D` of the `K` pairs are exactly recoverable; the rest are correct only at chance `1/V`. The optimal achievable recall for any linear readout of the `D` scalars is the Eckart–Young curve (EY), upper-bounded by `min(1, D/K) + (1−min(1,D/K))/V`.
> 2. **[PROVEN]** attention attains rank `K` (exact KV outer product) and hence recall `1`; the double dissociation (SSAS = 1.000 vs structurally-identical PPAP = 0.16) confirms one outer-product layer suffices and the scan class alone gates it.
> 3. **[ARGUED]** the *binding rank attainable by the leaky-scalar mechanism* is 1 per channel — each channel accumulates key-agnostically and implements no key-conditioned (outer-product) write/read — so the effective binding rank `D_eff` of the trained pure-scalar stack is `O(1)`, far below `D`.
> 4. **[PROVEN, measured]** with `D_eff ≈ 1`, `K = 8`, `V = 64`, the predicted recall is `≈ 0.139` (closed form) to `0.186` (best case), bracketing the measured `0.1406 / 0.1445`; inverting the bound yields `D_eff ≈ 1.02`.

What is a **clean theorem** (part 1, 2): the rank-`D` upper bound and attention's rank-`K` realization — pure linear algebra plus measurement. What is a **rigorous reduction with one modeling assumption** (part 3): that the fixed FFN/readout cannot synthesize key-conditioning absent in the scalars; the SSAS↔SSSS dissociation is the empirical discharge of that assumption. What is **measured corroboration** (part 4): the `D_eff ≈ 1` fit.

---

## 7. What is proven, argued, conjectured — the ledger

**[PROVEN]**
- Each channel's state is a rank-1 functional; the sqrt readout is a fixed bijection adding no dimension (§1).
- Exact MQAR ⇒ recovering a rank-`K` association; attention realizes it; recall ceiling = rank + chance (§2, eq. RankBound).
- `D` scalars with fixed linear readout ⇒ association rank ≤ `D` ⇒ Eckart–Young recall ceiling (§3, eqs. D-Bound, EY).
- The measured 14% is bracketed by the bound at `D_eff ≈ 1`; inversion gives `D_eff ≈ 1.02` (§5, code-run numbers).
- The flat-in-gap recall profile (capacity signature, not decay) is read directly from `hybrid_B.json` (§0).

**[ARGUED]** (rigorous, one stated assumption each)
- The leaky scalar mechanism has per-channel **binding** rank 1 because the increment is key-agnostic (first-order in the token stream); no outer product (§4). *Discharge:* SSAS (=1.000) vs SSSS (=0.14) double dissociation — the only difference is the added outer-product layer.
- Therefore `D_eff = O(1)` for the trained pure-scalar stack, not `D = 128` (§4). *Why not 128:* the 128 channels share a key-agnostic pool; channel count bounds rank from above but the mechanism does not attain it for binding.

**[CONJECTURE]** (open, stated as such)
- The exact effective bits-per-channel `b` (here back-solved to give `D_eff·b ≈ 6` bits ≈ one value); `b` depends on SNR/dynamic range of the bounded state and is not derived from first principles (§5 info route).
- That **no** training of the architecture-preserving pure-scalar scan reaches `D_eff > O(1)` without adding a binding primitive (attention, or the unrun complex/phase channel of FINAL_REPORT). The phase-GSSM is the principled attempt to lift `D_eff` by giving each channel a 2-D (complex) state that *can* carry a rotation-coded key→value phase — predicted to raise the rank ceiling; **unmeasured**.
- The precise constant in `D_eff ≈ 1` (vs, say, 1.5–2) across seeds/widths; one seed at one width here. `D_eff ≈ 1.02` is n=1.

---

## 8. Why this *strengthens* the framework paper

The scalar-channel limit is now a **prediction of the same operator algebra** that gives the wins. The reproducing-kernel readout `z_t = ⟨w_t, Φ_t⟩` (RKHS doc) is **rank-1 by construction** — the very property that makes the state bounded, parallel-scannable, and KV-cache-free is the property that caps associative-recall rank at `O(1)`. One structural fact (`z_t` is a scalar inner product) explains **both** the boundedness guarantee *and* the recall wall. The framework does not *excuse* 14%; it *computes* it (≈ 0.139 at `D_eff = 1`) and tells you the exact fix (add rank: one attention layer → rank `K` → 1.000; or a complex/phase channel → rank ≥ 2 per channel). This is the SSM hierarchy of the companion table made quantitative: **rank of the per-channel state is the capacity coordinate.** Scalar (GSSM/Mamba real) → rank 1, recall `O(1/K)`; complex-diagonal (S5/LRU/phase) → rank 2 per channel, strictly higher binding ceiling; full attention → rank `K`, exact. The wall is the bottom rung of a *ladder the framework draws*, not a hole in it.
